# sql-doc-gate — pre-commit gate: blocks commits while *.sql changes on the
# current branch are undocumented.
#
# Modes:
#   (default) check   — compares a fingerprint of the branch's *.sql changes
#       (vs BASE_BRANCH, including staged and working-tree edits) against the
#       fingerprint recorded the last time /schemalore completed. On a
#       mismatch, or when no fingerprint is recorded, the commit is blocked
#       with instructions.
#   --mark-done       — records the current fingerprint. The /schemalore
#       skill runs this as its final step after refreshing the docs; run it
#       manually only if the docs are already accurate.
#
# The fingerprint lives under .git/ (per-clone, never committed), so a fresh
# clone or a new branch always starts un-marked.
#
# Bypass a single commit (discouraged): git commit --no-verify
